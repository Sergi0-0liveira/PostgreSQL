### The first challenge was to create a invert index

###STEP 1 - Create Tables and insert the data into it

CREATE TABLE docs01 (id SERIAL, doc TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(id));

CREATE TABLE invert01 (
  keyword TEXT,
  doc_id INTEGER REFERENCES docs01(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO docs01 (doc) VALUES
    ('mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how'),
    ('the statements relate to one another A good example of a logic'),
    ('error might be take a drink from your water bottle put it in your'),
    ('backpack walk to the library and then put the top back on the'),
    ('syntactically perfect and in the right order but there is simply a'),
    ('mistake in the program The program is perfectly correct but it does'),
    ('not do what you intended for it to do A simple'),
    ('example would be if you were giving a person directions to a'),
    ('restaurant and said when you reach the intersection with the'),
    ('gas station turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red');

###STEP 2 - INSERTING INTO INVERT01 THE EVERY SINGLE WORD MAPPING IT TO DOCS01
  
  INSERT INTO invert01(keyword, doc_id) 
    SELECT DISTINCT unnest(string_to_array(lower(D.doc), ' ')), id
    FROM doc01 AS D
    ORDER BY id;
 
### CREATING A INVERTED index with STOP Words
###STEP 1 - Create Tables and insert the data into it
  
CREATE TABLE docs02 (id SERIAL, doc TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(id));

CREATE TABLE invert02 (
  keyword TEXT,
  doc_id INTEGER REFERENCES docs02(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
    
INSERT INTO docs01 (doc) VALUES
    ('mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how'),
    ('the statements relate to one another A good example of a logic'),
    ('error might be take a drink from your water bottle put it in your'),
    ('backpack walk to the library and then put the top back on the'),
    ('syntactically perfect and in the right order but there is simply a'),
    ('mistake in the program The program is perfectly correct but it does'),
    ('not do what you intended for it to do A simple'),
    ('example would be if you were giving a person directions to a'),
    ('restaurant and said when you reach the intersection with the'),
    ('gas station turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red');
    
### STEP 2 - Insert the info into invert02 but not considering STOP_WORD

INSERTO INTO invert02(keyword, doc_id)                                                                                                                                                          
  SELECT DISTINCT s.keyword AS keyword, id
  FROM docs02 AS D, unnest(string_to_array(lower(D.doc),' ')) s(keyword) 
  WHERE keyword NOT IN (select word from stop_words)
  ORDER BY id;
