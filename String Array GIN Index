### The first challenge was to create  GIN-based text[] reverse index 

###STEP 1 - Create Tables and insert the data into it

CREATE TABLE docs03 (id SERIAL, doc TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(id));

CREATE INDEX array03 ON docs03 USING gin(string_to_array(doc, ' ')  array_ops);

INSERT INTO docs03 (doc) VALUES
('mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how'),
('the statements relate to one another A good example of a logic'),
('error might be take a drink from your water bottle put it in your'),
('backpack walk to the library and then put the top back on the'),
('syntactically perfect and in the right order but there is simply a'),
('mistake in the program The program is perfectly correct but it does'),
('not do what you intended for it to do A simple'),
('example would be if you were giving a person directions to a'),
('restaurant and said when you reach the intersection with the'),
('gas station turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red');

INSERT INTO docs03 (doc) SELECT 'Neon ' || generate_series(10000,20000);
